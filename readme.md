Refreshing Java 
===============

**by Chapman Siu**

A short book on refreshing key Java 101 programming concepts.
This book was mainly written for my benefit as I transition
from Python to Java (and any other language in the future).

This book is Structured as follows:

1. Objects And Classes
2. A First Look At Java Source Code
3. Class Definitions
4. Conditional Statements And The Boolean Data Type
5. More About Data Types
6. Introduction To Program Design
7. Collections And Repetition
8. Fixed Size Collections
9. Software Testing
10. Using The Java Library
11. Designing Classes
12. Introduction To Inheritance
13. Polymorphism
14. Abstract Classes And Interfaces
15. Handling Errors
16. Graphical User Interface

Knowledge Checklist
-------------------

To check your knowledge make sure you can implement the following:

1. Something which takes an argument and then prints its category (demonstrate if else)
2. Something involving creating a hashtable, looping it and printing it out (demonstrate knowledge of data types)
3. An "easy" new data type (e.g. time or fraction)
4. Inheritance, create an animal, then add a subcategory.
5. Swing?
6. Final project wrap-up a simple game.

Others:

* Unit Testing
* Packaging Java code
