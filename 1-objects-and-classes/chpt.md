What is Java
============

Java is an object-orientated programming language. 
It is probably the most widely taught and popular
programming language.

A few differences compared to python

1. Every Java program must define a class, and
   all code must reside in this class.
2. Statically typed! Everything must have a type.
3. Must have the function: `public static void main(String[] args)`
