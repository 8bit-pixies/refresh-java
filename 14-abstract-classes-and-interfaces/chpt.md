Abstract classes and interfaces are used in Java to offer a structure of the class
(and subclasses) without really saying what it **must** do. So its like a skeleton, or
outline to what is to happen.

What are the differences between abstract classes and interfaces? In a nutshell it could
be framed like this:

>  Abstract classes are _guidelines_, while interfaces are _rules_.
