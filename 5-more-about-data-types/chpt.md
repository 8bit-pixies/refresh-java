Data Types
==========

Remember how I said Java is statically typed? In fact, I have 
already introduced this to you! In the previous section I 
initialised `age` by typing `int age`. This is esentially 
what it means is that the type of a variable is known at 
compile time. 

Java only supports the primitive data type which are:

*  `int`
*  `float`
*  `double`
*  `char`
*  `boolean`

You will notice that there is no `string` type (`char` and 
`string` types are different). 

But! Java does have a `String` _reference_ type (`string` with a capital
`S` and yes, it does make a difference). We will see more about it
in section 6.

There isn't too much to demonstrate here, as all these things will work
in the same way as Python.
